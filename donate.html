                    <h1>Donate</h1>
                    We accept donations through our gift account with the UW.
                    <a href="https://www.washington.edu/giving/make-a-gift/?page=funds&source_typ=3&source=UWAVEB">Click here to donate to UWave Radio</a>.

                    <h2>UWave Radio gift account FAQ</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How much can I donate?
                        Donors must give a minimum of $10; that is the only restriction.
                        There is no maximum amount that you can donate; the more the merrier!
                        Those who wish to donate amounts larger than $1,000, please contact
                        <a href="mailto:business@uwave.fm">business@uwave.fm</a> to clear with our
                        Business department first.</li>

                        <li>Do I have to donate online?
                        No. You can also donate with a check or cash by mail to:<br />
                        <address>
                            Box 358528
                            118115 Campus Way NE, UW1, Suite 281
                            Bothell WA 98011-8246
                        </address>
                        For check donations, please pay to the order of the University of Waishington.
                        On the memo line, write “UWave Radio” as shown below. Please note that it may
                        take some time for you to receive acknowledgment for a check or cash contribution.</li>

                        <li>What is the money used for?
                        As a growing community radio station, UWave Radio accumulates a big bill. We
                        want to have as much saved in emergency funds as we can so we can continue to
                        provide quality radio to our listeners. The money earned in the gift account
                        is used by UWave Radio only, and will be used for things such as to update
                        our music collection, pay for new equipment, purchase promotional materials,
                        and fund events. During our fund drives, UWave Radio will outline the specific
                        goal for funds. For example, if we need $800 for a new channel control mixer,
                        we will announce our goal on air (and also describe what a channel control mixer
                        is). The money we receive during that fund drive will go only to the purchase(s)
                        we announced.</li>

                        <li>What’s in it for me?

                        to the community. The more supporters we have, the better we are able to fund and
                        accomplish our goals as an organization.</li>
                    </ol>
