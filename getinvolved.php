                    <h1>Get Involved</h1>
                    There are a number of ways to get involved in UWave:
                    <ul>
                        <li><h4 class="red">Host a show</h4>
                            Have an idea for a music, talk or information show that you want to
                            bring to our community? Host a show at UWave Radio!<br />
                            No experience necessary, we will train you on how to use the equipment,
                            or help you with the details of pre-recording a show to play if you
                            aren't available to host your show from our broadcast studio. Fill out
                            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18veHb-LUaAYtyhzKSUSoa0FAbl6jbYYRYrZ2QcehRS8/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a> at the link above to start the process. We suggest at least 1
                            hour program length, and require that your show correspond with <a class="navlink" href="/about">UWave
                            Radio goals</a>.
                        <li><h4 class="red">Attend a meeting</h4>
                            UWave meets every other week on Friday from 1:15pm to 3:15pm in HH1210 (on
                            the <a href="https://www.uwb.edu" target="_blank">UW Bothell</a> campus). If you can't
                            make that, it's okay! Most departments meet at other times. If you know
                            which department you want to help out with, reach out to them by email
                            (<a href="contact">list of departments and their emails here</a>).
                        <li><h4 class="red">Submit an announcement</a></h4>
                            Interested in promoting your group or event through UWave? Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TyoM_hc1y2yPptSztskFrygPI4r6URx21GSx-1tbYNs/viewform" target="_blank">this
