    <h1>UWave at Your Event!</h1>
    <p>
        UWave will come to your on campus event and play music. To make this happen, we need a few things
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            At least 1 month notice
        </li>
        <li>
            A table for our equipment. Generally 2x4' or larger
        </li>
        <li>
            If the event is outside, a tent
        </li>
        <li>
            Access to power (eg a spider box for outdoor events)
        </li>
        <li>
            For on campus events, a cart to move our equipment
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once you've ensured that you have those things fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1STT_SlNuJ9-Bm5B47V8CK-iBE29GnuFQaD0X00CzjuU/viewform">this form</a>
