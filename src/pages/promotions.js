To submit one, fill our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TyoM_hc1y2yPptSztskFrygPI4r6URx21GSx-1tbYNs/viewform">PSA form</a>. If you need help with the wording, read through <a href="http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/participation/promoting-interest/public-service-announcements/main">this handy guide</a>.
