  <p>
    Have an idea for a music, talk or information show that you want to bring to our community? Host a show at UWave Radio!<br /> No experience necessary, we will train you on how to use the equipment, or help you with the details of pre-recording a show to play if you aren't available to host your show from our broadcast studio. Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18veHb-LUaAYtyhzKSUSoa0FAbl6jbYYRYrZ2QcehRS8/viewform">this form</a> at the link above to start the process. We suggest at least 1 hour program length, and require that your show correspond with <a className="navlink" href="/about">UWave Radio goals</a>.
  </p>
  <h4 className="red">Attend a meeting</h4>
  <p>
    UWave meets every week on Friday from 1:15pm to 3:15pm in HH1210 (on the <a href="https://www.uwb.edu">UW Bothell</a> campus). If you can't make that, it's okay! Most departments meet at other times. If you know which department you want to help out with, reach out to them by email (<a href="contact">list of departments and their emails here</a>).
  </p>
  <h4 className="red">Submit an announcement</h4>
  <p>
