                    <h1>UWave at Your Event!</h1>
                    UWave will come to your on campus event and play music. To make this happen, we need
                    a few things
                    <ul>
                      <li /> <b>At least 1 month notice</b>
                      <li /> A table for our equipment. Generally 2x4' or larger
                      <li /> If the event is outside, a tent
                      <li /> Access to power (eg a spider box for outdoor events)
                      <li /> For on campus events, a cart to move our equipment
                    </ul>
                    Once you've ensured that you have those things fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1STT_SlNuJ9-Bm5B47V8CK-iBE29GnuFQaD0X00CzjuU/viewform">this form</a>
