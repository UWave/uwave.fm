Over the last year, we applied and were
approved for a Low Power FM license from the FCC. You can view our future
broadcast range <a href="http://cdbs.recnet.net/fmq.php?facid=197326" target="_blank">here</a>. Within the next year, we hope our listeners will be tuning
in from their homes, work, cars, and online. We are growing every day!
