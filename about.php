                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p><i>UWave Radio is the campus-based community station of the Bothell area and
                      beyond. We are a center for community engagement, a hub for underrepresented
                      voices and music, an environment for professional development, and a
                      catalyst for social justice.</i></p><br />

                    <p>In 2012, a group of <a href="https://www.uwb.edu" target="_blank">University of Washington Bothell</a> students who shared a
                      common interest in community media began building a radio station from scratch.
                      We started broadcasting online in the spring of 2013 with a mixture of talk,
                      music, and educational programming. Over the last year, we applied and were
                      approved for a Low Power FM license from the FCC. You can view our future
                      broadcast range <a href="http://cdbs.recnet.net/fmq.php?facid=197326" target="_blank">here</a>. Within the next year, we hope our listeners will be tuning
                      in from their homes, work, cars, and online. We are growing every day! To learn

                    <p>Our organization is broken into four departments. Each department is made up
                      of two directors who manage the workflow and a group of volunteers who make
                      sure things get done. The departments are as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><b class="red">Business</b>  is in charge of the little details:
                        underwriting content, legal inquiries, fundraising, connecting with
                        local businesses, etc.</li>
                      <li><b class="red">Programming</b> manages on-air content. They organize shows,
                        curate the music library, and train new hosts and DJs.</li>
                      <li><b class="red">Promotions</b> is the voice of UWave. They get the word out
                        about volunteer opportunities, fundraisers and upcoming events.</li>
                      <li><b class="red">Technology</b> runs the computers, website and audio equipment,
                        including the studio and servers.</li>
                    </ul>
